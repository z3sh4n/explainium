## Agent Orchestration and Data Engineering: Test Your Knowledge

1.  The video presents agent orchestration as a new challenge, but argues that data engineers are well-equipped to handle it. What are *three* specific data engineering skills or areas of expertise mentioned that directly translate to success in agent orchestration?
2.  According to the video, what is a key reason why many impressive AI demos *fail to scale* effectively? Identify at least *two* specific challenges mentioned.
3.  The video mentions Langraph, Crew AI, and Autogen. Briefly describe what each of these tools essentially *replicates* from a data engineering perspective?
4.  The speaker posits that AI engineering might just be data engineering with "smarter pieces." Explain this statement in your own words. What is the *core skill* the speaker believes is more important than just writing effective prompts?
5.  What *specific actions* does the video encourage data engineers to take to prepare for the next evolution of data engineering and excel in the world of agent orchestration?
